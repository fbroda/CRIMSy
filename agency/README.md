# CRIMSY-agency
external job scheduler / manager for CRIMSy

## Note
If a node uses a certificate from an inofficial CA (e.g. a CRIMSy-CA), the Java 
executable must be called with the additional option:

      -Djavax.net.ssl.trustStore=PATH_TO_TRUSTSTORE

The appropriate truststore is available from the installation of CRIMSy.

**Work in progress - has bugs**
